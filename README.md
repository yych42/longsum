This is the source code of a legacy project. You may need to update some dependencies substantially to make this work; I made the mistake of not even freezing the dependency versions in the requirements.txt file. The main problem is that langchain has changed a lot of stuff since a year ago, so a lot of function calls probably will not work anymore. I apologize for the inconvenience.
